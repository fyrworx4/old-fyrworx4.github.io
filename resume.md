Education
---------

August 2019 - May 2023
:   **BBA, Computer Information Systems** - California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

<hr>

Experience
----------

April 2021 - Present
:   **Southern California Edison** - Cybersecurity Tools Architecture Intern

    I worked with implementing and fine-tuning various cybersecurity tools,
    including:
    * Tanium
    * Cylance
    * Splunk
    * Armis
    * Corelight / Zeek

    and more.
    
    I also had the opportunity to create phishing simulations and 
    perform a risk assessment on various internal webservers. Being
    in the Cybersecurity Tools Architecture department enabled me to
    play around with many expensive tools and get a feel for a company
    environment with a more mature cybersecurity program.

May 2020 - August 2020
:   **Talend** - Information Security Intern

    As an Information Security Intern, I modified company's Splunk
    architecture to follow best guidelines for third-party SOC integrations,
    as well as researched Google Drive and Sharepoint vulnerabilities,
    created a proof-of- concept for Cortex SOAR, and implemented Snort
    IDS into the company network.

Organizations
--------------------

Students With an Interest in the Future of Technolgy (SWIFT)
:   As a general member my first year, Vice President of Operations my
    second year, and now President for my third year, I've gained
    not only technical skills but also soft skills by:

    * collaborating with team members to create content for members,
    * presenting about various infosec-related topics,
    * leaded small workteams within SWIFT to provide hands-on workshops

    My involvement in SWIFT has made me realize that I have the highest
    potential to learn and grow when I'm surrounded by like-minded others.
    As the next President, I plan to take the concepts introduced this year
    and fully implement them next year, as well as expand that learning
    potential to the rest of the e-board and to the general members.

Management Information Systems Student Association
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
