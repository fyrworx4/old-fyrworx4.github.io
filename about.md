hi there. i'm taylor. ✌✨

currently attending Cal Poly Pomona and competing in various cyber competitions.

i'm also expanding my involvement in clubs and organizations on campus to leave a positive impact behind me; aspiring to work hard for things that are worth it, to learn from mistakes, and to be surrounded by individuals who inspire me.

either working out or dabbling with music production whenever I’m not studying. listen to some of my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fyrworx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">songs</a>!
