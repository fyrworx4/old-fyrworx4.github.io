Hello there ✌✨

I am currently representing my university at cybersecurity competitions as the captain of our CCDC team and an incoming team member for our CPTC team.

I'm also serving as the President of SWIFT (Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology), where I share my passions about cybersecurity with others.

In my free time, I am either working out or dabbling with music production whenever I’m not studying. Listen to some of my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fyrworx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">songs</a>!
