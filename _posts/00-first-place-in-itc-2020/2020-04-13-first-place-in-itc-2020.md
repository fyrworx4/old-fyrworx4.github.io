Ever heard of the saying “the show must go on?”

In this day and age, this quote has never been more true.

Things like work, school, and projects must be continued under these unexpected and unpredictable times. Or in this case, cybersecurity competitions.

Over the course of three weeks, my four teammates and I had recently worked on a case competition in Cal Poly Pomona's 24th annual [Information Technology Competition][itc-link], or ITC, under the Digital Forensics category.

We went in as Zeta ITC.

In the beginning, we all ran into issues, whether it be Autopsy crashing or trying to work with [VMware Fusison][vmware-fusion] on a Macbook Pro. Even with my knowledge in cybersecurity, digital forensics was still a new field to all of us, so it felt as if we were going in blind. But it was a fun experience nonetheless.

The day before our competition, I reiterated to my team that it’s not about what place we get, but instead it's about getting the experience and learning something new. As the team lead, I am very happy to see that my teammates have persevered and made it to the very end.

Overall our presentation went pretty smoothly but we were hit with tough questions at the end in which some of them we weren’t able to answer. But with only two other teams competing, we were guaranteed to place so we weren’t too worried.

In the end, our team won 1st place out of the three teams. We also received feedback on our report and presentation as well as suggestions to improve our methodologies when performing a forensics examination. Although earning 1st place is a bonus, the real prize was the experience.

The biggest learning lesson that I have gained was to never make assumptions in digital forensics. The goal of digital forensics is to gather evidence and present the evidence. TLDR: stick with the facts and the cold, hard evidence.

Overall the grind was well worth it. But there were three things that I took away from this competition:

- Having a diverse team with unique skill sets will strengthen your work.
- It’s more about gaining the experience rather than winning the competition. (This is a good talking point when you’re in a resume or job fair)
- [Google][google] is your best friend.
