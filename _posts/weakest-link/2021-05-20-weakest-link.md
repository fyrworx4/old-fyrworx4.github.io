## The CBA Peer Mentor Program

The **CBA Peer Mentor** program was started in Spring 2021 to enable freshmen in the College of Business Administration to connect and bond with each other. Being a CBA Peer Mentor was a paid position, and seeing how I enjoyed sharing my stories and motivating others, I felt like this position was right up my alley.

I applied and got the job, but this was a lot more than I bargained for.

## The Struggles

Similar to starting a new club, our team's main focus was outreach and getting a presence within our community. This was, in my opinion, the toughest part for me as a CBA Peer Mentor - I just couldn't do outreach and event planning.

One of my first few projects over the first month of the Spring semester was to plan a game night over Discord, as well as a LinkedIn Workshop. Seeing our low attendance had really discouraged me and made me believe that I just wasn't fit enough to be a CBA Peer Mentor.

The grueling task of having to plan entire events, while creating meetings and workshops for [SWIFT](https://www.calpolyswift.org) and having midterms at the same time had driven me insane. It was a time marked by high periods of stress, anxiety, and feeling out of my comfort zone tenfold.

My views on the CBA Peer Mentor team were negative as well -- I had felt that certain members of the team, including me, were carrying the weight of those that were not putting adequate effort. I had complained to my friends, rethought my life decisions, and just absolutely despised the program despite needing the job to earn some income.

## Paradigm Shift

At some point, I realized that it wasn't the program's fault, or my teammates' fault, that I was feeling this way.

That fault belonged to me.

I reconsidered my feelings and thoughts towards the program. Over time, I've learned to focus on the benefits of this program, both for the freshmen and myself.

I've reflected on this entire process of how I obtained this job and what my purpose is in this role. I joined because I wanted to share my knowledge on professionalism and topics such as how to network with others, apply and obtain internships, and the like. And I'm given the opportunity to do those exact things.

I've also helped out with moderating various events towards the end of April, including our First-Generation Panel event, which first-generation individuals talk about their experiences and how they were able to overcome their struggles. We had a list of 5 panelists scheduled about two weeks before the event. However, within days of the event, 4 out of 5 of them let us know that they were not able to make it. Now that we're scrambling for speakers, our supervisor shifted things a little, and now the main teammate planning this event, who also happened to be a first-generation student, was put on the list of panelists as well. I had also brought in one of my friends from SWIFT who was also a first-generation student, to be a panelist as well.

With our combined efforts, we were able to secure 4 panelists - two alumni and two current students.

The event consisted of prepared questions that I was planning to ask each of the panelists, ranging from basic introductions to new insights and lessons learned from their experiences. Overall the event was a success - we totaled in at 40 people in the videoconferencing room at once! I consider this event to be my biggest accomplishment and stepping stone in my event-planning confidence. Definitely a step-up from our first few events.

## Takeaways

One of the largest takeaways from being a CBA Peer Mentor program is taking accountability.

We are only as strong as our weakest link.

Being part of a team means being able to rely and trust on your teammates to do their job well, and if one person does not deliver, it affects the entire team. There were many instances where team members were not able to complete their tasks, myself included, but it served as a reminder to me that I need to step up my game and do my best in this job.

After all, I'm here to share my knowledge and help motivate others, and that's something that I truly believe in - helping others. Even if we might not enjoy some aspects of being a mentor (outreach and event planning for me), it's still important to do our job and do it well so that the program can be successful for years to come.

Another *huge huge huge* takeaway is getting the experience of starting something from the ground up. This is a unique experience that no student really has the opporutnity to get. Yes, you can get an e-board position at a club or organization to gain leadership experience, but being part of this program from the very beginning has taught me valuable lessons that no e-board position can ever offer.

It was a struggle. It felt like the most difficult thing in my life to put myself in a position where I was forced to use skills that I was poor at to complete assignmets and deliverables.

But did I learn a lot? Yes.

This has been one of the greatest learning experiences of my college career *because* I focused on my weakest skills. I'm only as strong as my weakest link.

It's going to feel weird to be outside your comfort zone. I understand. But it's something that I've learned to embrace, and as a result, grow immensely from it.

Totally worth it.
