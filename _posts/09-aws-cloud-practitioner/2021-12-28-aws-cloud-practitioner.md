The AWS Cloud Practitioner exam was the first certification exam I have taken in 3+ years. Similar to all the previous certification exams I've taken, I waited until the last few weeks until my test to study for this.

I thought that studying for this test was going to be a piece of cake, but after a while, I began to understand that AWS was more than I bargained for.

However, I was still able to pass the test and earn my certification. Here's how I did it:

# Practice Tests
Practice tests are **the** best resource you can find for AWS certs, or any cert available. I got them from Udemy and they turned out to be a lifesaver for the exam.

I purchased the Practice Test course for AWS Cloud Practitioner and went through each and every exam, one by one. I was able to average around 3 practice tests per day, taking each practice test about 2-3 times until I felt very comfortable with the content.

# The AWS Cloud Practitioner Course
This was a good introduction to AWS but it's not exhaustive enough for the cert exam. Use this to learn about AWS; use practice tests to prep you for the exam.

# Takeaways
Studying for this cert exam reminded me how much of a grind certification exams are. There were many times where I wanted to take a break and finish the rest of the practice exams tomorrow. But when your exam date is within a few days, you just have to keep going.
