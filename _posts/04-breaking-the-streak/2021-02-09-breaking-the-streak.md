This is NOT about a victory or a win.

This is about how losing taught me a lot more about my limits and my potential than any victory could have done. How failure can breed perseverance to eventual success.

The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, or CCDC, is a competition where multiple teams compete in a business-like scenario to secure a network against an active red team. Only the top 8 teams are allowed to move onto Regionals, where the stakes are much higher.

Before, Cal Poly Pomona’s CCDC team has effortlessly made it into the Regionals every year, but this year was different.

This year would be our first year in a long time where our team didn’t make it into Regionals. (We placed 9th.)

However, I wasn’t concerned about our placement. After all, getting the competition experience was what really matters to me, but nevertheless I feel that I did better than last year.

For once, I contributed more to the team through doing several injects, AKA responding to business requests. Some of them required us to install new software on our machines, others about recording a presentation for a panel.

What I also did was not touch the firewall as much. Before, I would be responsible for creating ACLs to block unwanted traffic. Many times, I would accidently block “good” traffic and would lose lots of points as a result of my mistakes. This time, I put that responsibility on the systems teams, to create host-based firewalls to block unwanted traffic, and focused less on firewall rules and more on business injects.

Looking at our score breakdown, we lost many points due to not keeping our services alive, as well as box resets (we would get penalized points for rolling back our boxes to a previous snapshot), but we boast the highest score on our injects. I can’t help but feel that my focus towards injects helped us gain a lot more points on our inject score, and I felt like I made a much larger contribution to the team than ever before.

With a lot more free time, I can continue to focus on becoming more robust than ever before.
