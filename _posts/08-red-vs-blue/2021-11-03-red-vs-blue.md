Red vs. Blue is an adversarial simulation competition to provide students with a unique, hands-on experience of defending Linux and Windows machines from an active threat actor. It's modeled after the CCDC competition to allow students to get the feel and rigor of a cyber competition, integrated with business objectives.

It's *not* an overstatement to say that this is one of the best projects that our student organization, SWIFT, has ever done. This is something that I don't think anyone else, or any other school, has done before.

This has been one of the greatest successes of our organization so far. We had around 40 members participate in our Red vs. Blue event, which is way more than what we expected; we brought in alumni from the olden days to help out with the red team

Long story short, this year, we're breaking new grounds in SWIFT.

Here's how we did it.

## The Setup

Preparing for Red vs. Blue began in the summer, when my good friend Alex pitched a Star Wars themed idea
